## :clipboard: Brief intro:
Saeed Shurrab earned his B.Sc. degree in Industrial and Systems Engineering from the Faculty of Engineering at the Islamic University of Gaza, Gaza Strip, Palestine in 2014. He worked as a part-time teaching assistant at the Islamic University of Gaza for two years (2014-2016). Further, he held a production and quality management position for five years (2014-2019) at a local industrial company in Gaza Strip.

His keen interest in data analytics as well as his beliefs in the role that data play in creating robust decisions and better solutions encouraged him to invade the field of data science. He earned the German Academic Exchange Scholarship (DAAD) in 2019 to pursue an M.Sc degree in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence at Jordan University of Science and Technology and earned the degree in 2022 with distinction. His main research interests are in the area of:

1. Computer vision.
2. Self supervised learning in medical imaging.
3. Deep learning in medical images.
